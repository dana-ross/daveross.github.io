                    techniques used in functional programming.</p>
                <blockquote>Let’s explore these principles by looking at a function from WordPress itself, one of my favorites&hellip;absint()
                    has perfect referential transparency. No matter what value you pass it, you’ll always get the same result
                    back. It doesn’t affect any variables outside itself, it doesn’t output anything to the browser, and
                    it doesn’t touch the filesystem or the database. There’s no side-effects.</blockquote>

                    <p>Adrian
                        <em>(Frutiger, not Pennino)</em> is a server for hosting web fonts. It scans all the fonts in a directory
                        and automatically generates CSS with @font-face declarations for individual fonts or families. Caching
                        headers are added to all responses so browsers know not to request the same files repeatedly, while CORS
                        and filename obfuscation helps comply with security restrictions in some fonts' licenses.</p>
    
                    <p>Basically, it lets you serve fonts for your sites from a central location so they're not sitting in your
                        project's repo. It also helps prevent you from being a one-stop distribution site for the fonts you paid
                        good money for.

                <p>HTTP/2 is the newest version of the HTTP protocol that powers the Web. Based on the SPDY protocol from Google,
                    it uses multiple binary streams to transmit more than one file over one connection at the same time.
                    Server Push is how an HTTP/2 server starts sending additional files, such as JavaScript and CSS, to the
                    browser before the browser realizes it needs them.</p>
                <p>This plugin enables server push for local JavaScript and CSS resources enqueued in the page. Plugins & themes
                    that output tags directly in the page markup won't be affected.</p>

                </a>
                <p>Dave’s WordPress Live Search adds “live search” functionality to your WordPress site. As visitors type words
                    into your WordPress site’s search box, the plugin continually queries WordPress, looking for search results
                    that match what the user has typed so far.</p>

                <p>The live search technique means that most people will find the results they are looking for before they finish
                    typing their query, and it saves them the step of having to click a submit button to get their search
                    results.
                </p>

                <p>This plugin has 10,000+ active installs.</p>

                    of how much time the project will take. It’s preferable to work with a client early in a project to ask
                    for more hours than when close to launch.

                <p>Reminiscence on an unofficial "feature" a developer built into an app our team maintained, which became "official"
                    after the Customer Service discovered it and made it part of their toolbox.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>One of our programmers built an Easter egg of sorts, what came to be known as the W screen. To this day
                        I’m still not sure what the W stood for, but I think it was what the heck did this order look like
                        when it arrived on the legacy system?. It took our logged copy of the order transmission, parsed
                        out the individual fields, and displayed them.</p>

                <p>A tale from the early days of my career, late 1999, when the presence of &amp;nbsp; caused panic and confusion
                    among a team of newly-minted developers.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Since CSS 2.1, browsers have rendered empty table cells just like the rest of their brethren and you
                        have to use a barely-known CSS2 declaration of “empty-cells: hide” to make the browser skip drawing
                        them. But back in those days of Netscape 4 and IE 5, the default behavior was to “collapse” those
                        cells automatically.</p>

                <p>I started my career in the shadow of the Dotcom crash, and had to take a job with a technology that pre-dated
                    SQL.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>I waited until a group of schoolchildren filtered out of the minicomputer room, then flipped the bird
                        to a photo of its creator. I doubt I was the first. The software that bears his name defined the
                        first seven years of my career and cost me about $1,000 to escape. Much of my time is spent blissfully
                        reminiscing about technologies I’ve used in my life. There’s no such affection for Pick.</p>

                <p>A light post for Johnny Holland, a defunct UX web site. Tales from my experience as an arcade attendant and
                    a classic game collector provide context for lessons in providing a solid, delightful user experience.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>A recent article on “What 8-Bit Video Games Can Teach Us About Design And UX” got me reminiscing about
                        those early days. There are lessons those digital pioneers can teach us, and they are as applicable
                        to today’s web sites and gadgets as they were to those noisy arcades.</p>
